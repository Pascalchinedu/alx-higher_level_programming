| [0-postive_or_negative.py](https://github.com/Pascalchinedu/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/0-positive_or_negative.py)| A program that assigns a random number to the variable `number` each time it is executed |
| | Source code can be found [here](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/e4tR3cjFHqhelf4y485-zQ)  |
| | The varible `number` will store a different value everytime you run the program |
| | The output of the program should be: |
| |   - The number followed by |
| |     - if the number is greater than 0: `is positive |
| |     - if the number is 0: `zero` |
| |     - if the number is less than zero: `is negative` |

| [1-last_digit.py](https://github.com/Pascalchinedu/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/1-last_digit.py)| A program that assigns random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. |
| | Source code can be found [here](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Vku0ZPFeDPuXUKD8nZ4mOQ)  |
| | The varible `number` will store a different value everytime you run the program |
| | The output of the program should be: |
| |   - The string "Last digit of", followed by |
| |     - the number, followed by |
| |     - the string "is", followed by the last digit of "number", followed by |
| |     * if the last digit is greater than 5: the string "and is greater than 5" |
| | * if the last digit is 0: the string "and is 0" |
| | * if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string "and is less than 6 and not 0" |
