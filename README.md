### Getting Started 
To get started with Python, you will need to install the Python interpreter on your computer. You can do this by downloading the Python installer from the [Python Website.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have installed Python, you can start writing Python code. You can do this in any text editor, but it is a good idea to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as VScode.
